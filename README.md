Research with Cornell Lab of Ornithology North American bird image data set.

I am currently working my way through FastAI's MOOC released January 2019. Jeremy Howard continually indicates that you can get world class results in a few lines of code. I was admittedly skeptical, but working through the first lesson and applying the example code to a dataset of North American birds, I was able improve upon current state-of-the-art accuracy rate (86.03% versus 82.79%).
